## About me

Hi! 

My name is Szymon and I come from Poland. I'm 34 years old, I have moved to Vienna since 2012 until now. At the moment I'm focusing on searching for an entry level job as a junior java developer.
I'm learning with a great mentor and after a 1,5 years journey with java it comes time for new challenges as a professional developer. 

## My first bigger project

I am actually working on one bigger project - managment system for cinema network. It is made with jdbi as persistence, spring core for dependency injection and spark web framework for REST Api. Testing - Junit5 + AssertJ + Mockito

Planned finish of the project: 15 september.

## My projects

I already finished 3 simple training projects. They don't have a persistence layer - I wanted to train the project's architecture, REST API, collections and composition.

REST API in my projects ist made with  Spark web framework. I've already trained API's with Spring Web, but for my simple projects I needed something lightweight.
 Also I have made mappings using only GET methods.

I try to develop using TDD approach,  because I like to have fast feedback about current changes in my code.

Projects:

- cars-app. Cars management system with REST API. I used layer architecture in DDD style. 

- multimodule-cars-app. Cars management system with three separate modules in onion architecture and little bit DDD. REST API included.

- shopping. App to track shopping activities of customers. I made it to train my skills in collections, mostly maps. I will made REST API, at the moment I'm making service class
