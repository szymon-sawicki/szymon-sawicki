## About me

Hi! 

My name is Szymon and I come from Poland. I'm 34 years old, I have moved to Vienna since 2012 until now. At the moment I'm focusing on searching for an entry level job as a junior java developer.
I'm learning with a great mentor and after a 1,5 years journey with java it comes time for new challenges as a professional developer. 

## My projects

I have finished my first serious project - backend for cinemas network - with MySQL (persistence framework - jdbi) as database and REST API for communication with frontend (web framework - spark framework). My next project is already in early stage of development - it will be app for sales company with multiple shops and warehouses made in spring enviornment and microservices architecture.

I also finished 3 simple training projects. They don't have a persistence layer - I wanted to train the project's architecture, REST API, collections and composition.

REST API in my projects ist made with  Spark web framework. I've already trained API's with Spring Web, but for my simple projects I needed something lightweight.
 Also I have made mappings using only GET methods.

Projects:

- cars-app. Cars management system with REST API. I used layer architecture in DDD style. 

- multimodule-cars-app. Cars management system with three separate modules in onion architecture and little bit DDD. REST API included.

- shopping. App to track shopping activities of customers. I made it to train my skills in collections, mostly maps. I will made REST API, at the moment I'm making service class
